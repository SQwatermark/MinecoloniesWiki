<p>The Town Hall is the central part of your colony.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Town Hall block <strong>cannot</strong> be crafted until <strong>after</strong> you have already placed the Town Hall you get from the <a href="../../source/items/supplycampandship">Supply Ship/Camp</a>. If needed, it can also be obtained in creative mode like any other block or by commands.</p>

<h2 id="starting-a-new-colony">Starting a New Colony</h2>

<h3 id="scouting-the-area">Scouting the Area</h3>

<p>Make sure you scout your area carefully before you decide where you want to place your Town Hall. Your colony will start with a 4 chunk radius (4 chunks in each direction) from the Town Hall block. Make sure this is where you want your colony to be.</p>

<h3 id="placing-your-town-hall">Placing your Town Hall</h3>

<p>After you have carefully decided where you want to place your Town Hall (remember, the position where you placed the Town Hall block will be the center of your colony’s protected area. Once placed, the area will be set and cannot be changed), use your [build tool] (../items/buildtool) to place the Town Hall block.</p>

<p>Right-click the ground in the area you want to place the Town Hall. The building GUI will display showing the 3D preview of the building. You will be able to use the arrow buttons to move the building to the location you desire.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you use the + and - options in the GUI to make sure you have the ground level of the hut where you want the ground level to be. Not all hut blocks sit on the ground.</p>

<p>Once you commit to the placement of the Town Hall (green checkmark), the Town Hall block will be placed.</p>

<h3 id="creating-your-colony">Creating your Colony</h3>

<p>Once you have placed the Town Hall block you will need to right-click on it and select Create New Colony.
<img src="../../assets/images/gui/th_colonycreationGUI.png" alt="Creating New Colony" /></p>

<p>A new colony will be created, the area of your colony will be established, and the entire area will be protected.</p>

<h3 id="protection-area">Protection Area</h3>

<p>When you start a colony, the area that is initially set also has protections added to it. The protection system includes blocking any player from placing/breaking or interacting with blocks of any kind, placing lava or water, and placing/lighting TNT. Once established it will also show in the informational screen.</p>

<p>The protected area of your colony (once the Town Hall has been placed) will depend on the configuration, but will be 4 chunks radius by default, measured from where you placed your Town Hall block the first time. Therefore, plan carefully where you want to place your Town Hall. Your protected colony area includes mountains, hills, lakes, oceans, caves, world generated structures, etc. from bedrock to the sky limit.</p>

<p>Due to the protected area of each colony, you have to carefully scout your surroundings to make sure you are clear of any other colonies nearby preventing you from placing your Town Hall or limiting your colony area in that direction.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once you place your Town Hall block, this will be the CENTER of your Town’s protected radius. If you decide that you want your actual Town Hall building to be built in a different location (within your currently set protected radius), you can break the block and place it again with your build tool. Removing and replacing the Town Hall block will NOT remove the Protected area of your Town. The only way to remove the protected area of your colony so that you can place a Town Hall somewhere else is by a person with OP or admin permission deleting your colony through <a href="../systems/command">commands</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can configure your own colony area radius in the minecolonies-common.toml file inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">../config/</code> folder of your own world/server.</p>

<p>If there is another colony too close to your current position, you won’t be able to place a Town Hall.</p>

<p>If you try to place another Town Hall outside of your protected area, you will get a message: <br />
