<p>The multi-piston looks like a smooth andesite block with a hole in each face. It lets you move multiple blocks at a time.</p>

<p>The multi-piston can be crafted at the <a href="../../source/buildings/mechanic">Mechanicâ€™s Hut</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="the-multi-pistons-gui">The Multi-Pistonâ€™s GUI</h2>

<p>Place the multi-piston beside, above, or below the blocks you want to move, then right-click it to open the GUI.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="../../assets/images/gui/multiblockgui.png" alt="Multi-Piston GUI" /></p>
<p><br /></p>

<p>You will see 4 blue arrows, a + and a - with Range: and Speed: in the center. The arrows refer to the cardinal directions, up for North, down for South, right for East, and left for West. The + is to raise and the - is to lower.  The range is 10 blocks and the speed: is 1-3, 3 being the fastest.</p>

<p>You will need to left-click on one of the arrows, +, or - and it will turn green. This shows the directions the blocks will move when the multi-piston is activated by redstone. Then right-click on another arrow, +, or - for the direction the blocks will move when the redstone signal is off. This arrow will turn red.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To set the red arrow, the blocks that you want to move must already be there.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> All blocks being moved must be the same in order to work.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There must be enough room for all the blocks to move or it will stop.</p>
