<p>The Knight in Training will train at the Combat Academy to become a <a href="../../source/workers/guard">Guard</a>. They will hit a practice dummy with a sword to increase their level without a risk of dying to mobs.</p>

<p>Knights in Training are not actual Guards even though they are dressed in the usual Guard clothes. They will not help defend your colony, only Guards will do that.</p>
