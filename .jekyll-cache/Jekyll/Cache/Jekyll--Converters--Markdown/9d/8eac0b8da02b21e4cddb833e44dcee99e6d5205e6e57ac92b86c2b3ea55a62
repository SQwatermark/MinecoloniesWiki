<p>The Forester is one of the most essential workers in your colony. They will chop trees to provide the wood for all your colonyâ€™s needs. The Forester will also plant a sapling in the treeâ€™s place of the same variety they just chopped down (provided that the tree dropped saplings and the setting is on in the Foresterâ€™s Hut block GUI). The Forester will only plant a sapling AFTER chopping down a tree. If there are no trees nearby, they will NOT plant any saplings to create a tree.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can remove any trees/saplings and replant any type of sapling in any pattern or shape you need to create a perfect grove for easier access and less walking around, which means more efficient chopping.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In Minecraft 1.16+ Foresters require hoes (for breaking leaves).</p>
