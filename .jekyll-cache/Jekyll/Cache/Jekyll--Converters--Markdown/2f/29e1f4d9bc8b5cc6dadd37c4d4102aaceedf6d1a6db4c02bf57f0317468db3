    There is no recipe for the Ancient Tome. It must be obtained as a drop.

<p><br /></p>

<p>The Ancient Tome is a glowing book thatâ€™s dropped by raiders (barbarians, pirates, vikings, egyptian raiders, etc) during raids. The Ancient Tome cannot be crafted and is only available as a drop.

<h2 id="using-the-ancient-tome">Using the Ancient Tome</h2>

<p>There are two uses for the Ancient Tome, one use for the player and one for the <a href="../../source/workers/enchanter">Enchanter</a>. The playerâ€™s use is that if you have the Ancient Tome in your inventory, it will glow when there is going to be a raid that night. The Enchanterâ€™s use is to use the experience they collect from other workers to turn the Ancient Tome into a Book of Enchantment. When they do this, it will use up the Ancient Tome.</p>
