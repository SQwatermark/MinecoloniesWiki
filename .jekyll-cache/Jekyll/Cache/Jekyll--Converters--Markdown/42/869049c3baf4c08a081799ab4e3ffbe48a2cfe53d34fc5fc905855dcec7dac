<p>The Mine is where the Miner will mine for ores and materials. Once they are hired, the Miner will create a shaft downward and then branch out.</p>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> The shaft the Miner creates downwards will go to a specific depth depending on the level of the Mine. So if you want them to go deeper and get to the good ores, you will have to upgrade the Mine.</p>

<h2 id="mine-gui">Mine GUI</h2>

<p>When accessing the Mine’s hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:</p>

    <ul>
      
        <li><strong>Hut Level:</strong> Tells you the type of hut and the build level of the building you have selected.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Worker Assigned:</strong> Tells you the worker assigned to this building and their worker level. The worker levels up in time by working. The higher their level, the faster and more efficient they will be.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Manage Workers:</strong> Lets you change which worker is assigned to work at this hut. There can only be one worker at each hut. <b>Note:</b> this only works if you have turned the worker hiring mode in the <a href="../../source/buildings/townhall"> Town Hall</a> block to manual, otherwise your citizens will be hired automatically.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Recall Worker:</strong> Recalls the worker at this building to their hut block. You might use it if they are stuck somewhere, you want to see what they have, or want to give them something directly.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> Lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for this hut. To learn more about the building system, please visit the <a href="../../source/workers/builder"> Builder</a> page.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Delivery Priority:</strong> You can set the priority that a <a href="../../source/workers/courier"> Courier</a> will visit this hut and pick up items (when the worker at this hut issues a request), or you can tell Deliverymen to <i>never</i> visit this hut to pick up items. You can also tell a Deliveryman to do a pickup now using the Request Pickup Now button. (For the pickup priority, 10 is the highest.)</li>
      
        <li><strong>List of Recipes and Teach Recipe:</strong> When clicking the list of recipes button, you see all the recipes you have taught this hut and can remove them. When clicking teach recipe, it opens a crafting grid which allows you to teach this hut recipes (not the worker).</li>
      
        <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> Here you can access the hut block's storage, where the worker at this hut takes and deposits materials. They will also use any <a href="../../source/items/rack"> Racks</a> or chests in the hut, so be sure to check those as well!</li>
      
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Levels:</strong> The level refers to the platforms the Miner will place every 3 blocks down. Here you can assign what level of the Mine the Miner will create their mineshafts (nodes). If a level has a red number next to it, that means the Miner is currently mining that level. The Miner will ignore orders to mine at a specific level until the entire mineshaft is completed to the maximum depth their hut's level allows.</li><br />
