<p>The Tavern is like a <a href="../../source/buildings/house">House</a> in that it houses citizens, however, the Tavern houses four instead of one and canâ€™t be upgraded to house more.</p>

<p>Every so often, visitors will come to the Tavern. You can recruit these visitors (with items) to live and work in your colony. Donâ€™t attack them, theyâ€™ll fight back!
Upgrading the Tavern will garner more and better visitors.</p>

<p>Recruiting used to be part of the <a href="../../source/buildings/townhall">Town Hall</a> but has been moved here.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Tavern can only be upgraded to level 3, not level 5. You can also only have 1 Tavern per colony.</p>

<h2 id="tavern-gui">Tavern GUI</h2>

<p>When accessing the Tavernâ€™s hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/taverngui.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Tavern Hut GUI" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <br />
    <ul>
      
        <li><strong>Hut Level:</strong> This tells you the level of the hut you have selected.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Assign Citizens:</strong> This lets you change which citizens are assigned to this hut. If it says Assign 0 Citizens, that means you've run out of room in this hut to house citizens and will have to remove some (the button underneath their name) to add more. <b>Note-</b>this only works if you have turned the housing assignment mode in the <a href="../../source/buildings/townhall"> Town Hall</a> block to manual, otherwise your citizens will be housed automatically.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Build Options:</strong> This lets you create a build, upgrade, reposition, or repair build order for this hut. To learn more about the building system, please visit the <a href="../../source/workers/builder"> Builder</a> page.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Recall Citizens:</strong> Teleports all the citizens living here to the hut block.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Inventory:</strong> This opens an inventory space where you can store anything you like, as the citizens staying in the hut don't use it.</li>
      
    </ul>
