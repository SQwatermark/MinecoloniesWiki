<h3 id="before-you-build-any-other-building-you-must-build-the-builders-hut-if-the-builders-hut-is-not-built-the-builder-cannot-build-other-buildings">Before you build <em>any</em> other building, you must build the Builder’s Hut. If the Builder’s Hut is not built, the Builder cannot build other buildings.</h3>

<p>Before you choose a place to build the Builder’s Hut, take into account the distances among the other possible building sites and obstacles like water, trees, caves, mountains, lava sources, etc. After you have selected a place for the hut, you have to craft the Builder’s Hut block and place it with your <a href="../items/buildingtool">Building Tool</a>. Once the hut is placed, the Builder will be automatically assigned (or you can manually assign one with the best <a href="../systems/workerinfo">Traits</a> for a Builder if you changed this in the settings tab in the <a href="../../source/buildings/townhall">Town Hall’s GUI</a>.</p>

<p>Now you will have to issue the build assignment so the Builder can build their own hut first. The Builder will ask for the materials they need. Make sure to check the <a href="../../source/items/resourcescroll">Resource Scroll</a> or the second page of the <a href="../../source/buildings/builder">Builder’s Hut</a> to see what materials the Builder is requesting for any build/upgrade. Any material in the list that is still missing will be in red letters.</p>

<p>Once the Builder’s Hut is built you can now build anything you want, like worker huts, buildings, decorations, or your own schematics.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Note:</strong> The Builder can only build or upgrade any other hut up to the level of their own hut. So, in order for the Builder to upgrade any building, the Builder’s Hut must be upgraded first. Then the Builder will be able to upgrade any other building(s).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="builders-hut-gui">Builder’s Hut GUI</h2>

<p>When accessing the Builder’s Hut block by right-clicking on it, you will see a GUI with different options:</p>

    <ul>
      
        <li><strong>小屋等级:</strong> 显示你选中的小屋的种类和等级。</li>
      
        <li><strong>工人安排:</strong> 显示你被安排在这栋建筑的工人和他们的等级。工人边工作边升级。等级越高，工作效率越高，速度越快。</li>
      
        <li><strong>管理工人:</strong> 让你更改在这个小屋工作的工人。每一间小屋一个工人。<b>注①：</b>只有你把<a href="../../source/buildings/townhall">市政厅</a>方块内的工人雇佣模式调为手动，此条目才能生效。否则你的市民还是只会被自动雇佣。</li>
      
        <li><strong>召集工人:</strong> 召集在本建筑的工人到他们自己的小屋方块边。你可能因为他们卡在某个地方，或者想看看他们有什么东西，或者想直接给他们某样东西。</li>
      
        <li><strong>建筑选项:</strong> 让你可以创造、升级、复原、或者维修建筑。了解更多关于建筑系统的东西，请查看<a href="../../source/workers/builder"> 建筑工</a> 页面。</li>
      
        <li><strong>运输优先:</strong> 你可以设置<a href="../../source/workers/courier">运输工</a>访问该小屋的优先权（当小屋内的工人发出请求时，他们会来捡起物品），或者设置让运输工<i>不要</i>来该小屋取物品，也可以按下【请求即刻取走物品】的按钮。</li>
      
        <li><strong>配方列表 教学配方:</strong> 当你点击菜单列表按钮时，将会展示你教授给该小屋的配方，也可以在此页面移除他们。点击教学配方，将会打开合成表，你可以通过这个方式将配方教授给该小屋（而不是工人!）</li>
      
        <li><strong>存储物:</strong> 你可以在这里打开小屋方块的存储，这里是工人存取材料的地方。他们也会使用<a href="../../source/items/rack">架子</a>和箱子，如要看看存储，也要检查看看小屋内的架子和箱子！</li>
      
    </ul>

<div class="col-sm-12 col-md"><br />
    <p>By pressing the arrow button in the top right corner of the GUI, you will be taken to page 2 of the GUI where you will find the following:</p>

  </div>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<li><strong>Required Resources:</strong> These are the resources that the Builder will need for the build order they are currently working on. This amount will change as they place blocks and will show <strong>only</strong> what blocks the Builder still needs to place. The blocks in red are the ones neither you nor the Builder has in their inventory.</li>

<p><br /></p>

<p style="color:Blue;"><b>Important Note:</b> After pressing the <b>BUILD</b> button you will see a new list of all the items required for that build. There are some options here, but the most important option is that you <i>MUST CONFIRM</i> the build by pressing the <b>Build Building</b> button so the build order is created.</p>

<p style="color:Blue;"><b>Important Note:</b> After pressing the <b>UPGRADE</b> button you will see a new list of all the items required for that build. There are some options here, but again, the most important option is that you <i>MUST CONFIRM</i> the upgrade by pressing the <b>Upgrade Building</b> button so the build order is created.</p>

<p>After pressing the <b>Build Options</b> button you have a few options to consider:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <img src="../../assets/images/gui/upgradebuild.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="Upgrade Building GUI" />
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-12 col-md">
    <ul>
       <ul>
      
        <li><strong>Schematic Style:</strong> Here you can verify the style of schematics you have currently. You can change the style, but it's not recommended that you change it since it will most likely be in a different position.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Builder:</strong> Here is where you can choose what Builder you want on the project. If the hut is out of your Builders' range, this is where you can manually assign one.</li>
      
        <li><strong>List:</strong> This is the list of resources that the Builder will need for the schematic style selected.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Repair:</strong> This is to repair a building according to its schematic. This will remove any changes that a player has made to the current building.</li>
      
        <li><strong>Upgrade:</strong> When you are ready to upgrade to the next level. Upgrading will come with benefits, like more furnaces for a Smelter to use (for example).</li>
      
        <li><strong>Deconstruct:</strong> To deconstruct the building. After the Builder is done breaking the building, click the Pick Up button, which will appear where the Deconstruct button was. You will get the building's hut block, which will keep its current level. This is so you can place it somewhere else using the <a href="../../source/items/buildtool"> build tool</a>.</li>
      
    </ul>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3 id="a-few-things-to-consider">A few things to consider</h3>

<p>For the placement of the Builder’s Hut, you should consider having the hut in the middle of where you plan to have the rest of your buildings so that the Builder has less of a distance to walk between their hut and the build sites.</p>

<p>The Builder will not start another build assignment until they have finished the current one.</p>

<p>You can go to the <a href="../../source/buildings/townhall">Town Hall’s GUI</a> and click on the Work Orders tab and cancel the current build as well as arrange the priorities of the other build orders you have there. If you cancel a work order and it was being built already, when you assign the build order again, the Builder will continue where they left off.</p>

<p>If the Builder removes a block (dirt, wood, planks, glass, etc.) while building and/or upgrading, they will keep it in their inventory and dump any items in their inventory at the end of a build into the Builder’s Hut inventory.
