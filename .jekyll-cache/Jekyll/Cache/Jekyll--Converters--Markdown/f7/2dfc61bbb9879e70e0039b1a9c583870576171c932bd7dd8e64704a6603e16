<p>Shingles are decorative roofing tiles for the tops of buildings. Shingles come in all wood types, including cactus planks, and many different colors.</p>

<p>There is even a shingle half slab for the crown of the roof that comes in all the colors as well!</p>

<p>Shingles can be crafted at the <a href="../../source/buildings/sawmill">Sawmill</a> and dyed at the <a href="../../source/buildings/dyer">Dyerâ€™s Hut</a>.
<br /></p>

<h2 id="using-shingles">Using Shingles</h2>

<p>Use shingles like you would use stairs to create roofs for buildings.</p>
