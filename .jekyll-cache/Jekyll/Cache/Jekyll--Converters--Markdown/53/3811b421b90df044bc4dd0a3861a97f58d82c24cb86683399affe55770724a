<p>The Dyer is part of the production of the your colony. The Dyer will craft dyes and dyed items, as well as red nether bricks and dark prismarine. They wonâ€™t dye concrete or concrete powder, though. The Dyer will only make these items when they have been taught the recipes, receive a request for an item, and have the needed materials. (The Dyer automatically knows how to make green dye and red sand, however.)</p>

<p>The Dyer will require fuel to use in their furnace(s).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Dyer can only learn a set number of recipes based on their hut level. So:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Hut Level</th>
      <th>Recipes</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>

      <td>10</td>

    </tr>
